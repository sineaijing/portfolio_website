            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p> My name is Sine Ai Jing. <br><br>   
                I am a London-based technologist and data analyst working at the intersection of creative coding, data analysis, and politics.<br><br>   
                I am a graduate student of MSc Computing and Creative Industry (MOD) from the Creative Computing Institute at University of the Arts London. My studies and work have given my insight into data's potential and limitations - both as a business asset and as a tool for radical change.<br><br>   
                My work revolves around accountability and literacy, leveraging a range of technologies and methodologies, including data scraping, visualisation, analysis, and machine learning.<br><br>

                        <p> Through the ‘making’ and visualisation of a latent space, this project aims to uncover queer data potentials within the space looking both at the training data and the architecture of the AI model.<br><br> 
                            Concretely, I trained a generative Variational Autoencoder on images of sea slugs - a very queer creature of the sea!<br><br>           
                            The neural network was built with PyTorch and the latent space visualisation made with Three.JS and React.JS.<br><br>                       
                            The work was exhibited at the Autonomous Sheep exhibition, "HARDWired: Decoding the Tech Unconscious" in Jan/Feb 2024.<br><br>

                        <p>Prompted by studies and lived experiences showing how Black and People of Color’s symptoms, illnesses and pain are less likely to be taken seriously within western medical institutions, this project is an attempt to reimagine how to perceive, articulate and visualise pain.<br><br>
                            Taking inspiration from the pain chart used in many US medical institutions to fill the gap between the patients' feeling of pain and symptoms and their description of it. Finetuning a 
                            DistilGPT2 model with text statements about people experiences of pain and their visits to the doctor and generating on a Stable Diffusion model, I seek to interrogate how we are expected to talk about our pain versus how we actually talk about it. What does this do to our understanding and perceivement of pain, and it is possible to create a better, more relatable pain chart.
